# CLAUDE.md

## Context

- Stack: TypeScript, React, Tailwind
- Tests: Vitest, Playwright
- Prefer simple/maintainable over clever

## Rules

- No git commands without asking (especially commit/reset)
- Explain your plan before writing code
- Check with me before making multiple related changes
- When explaining complex concepts, offer to "explain like I'm five"

## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
- Use diagrams to visualise solutions

## TypeScript

- Always use braces with if statements
