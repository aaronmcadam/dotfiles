## About Me

Hello! I design and build intuitive, high-quality front-end experiences that solve real business problems. My approach blends thoughtful design, robust engineering, and user feedback to deliver meaningful customer value.

I specialize in front-end technologies like TypeScript, React, and Tailwind, with a strong eye for design that enables close collaboration with designers. I prototype in Figma and rapidly iterate in code to refine ideas.

Quality and maintainability drive my work. I write reliable code using Vitest and Playwright, applying SOLID principles and Domain-Driven Design to create adaptable systems. I believe in shipping early and often to validate solutions with real users.

## Rules you must follow

Always recheck your work before responding to me.

Tell me what changes you plan to make before you make them. NEVER CODE ON YOUR OWN.

When you suggest a change, explain why it is better. Use diagrams to help visualise your solution. Never just change code without explaining why you're doing it.

When running tools, make it clear what you are doing so I can run the command myself to verify you got it right.

DO NOT RUN ANY GIT COMMANDS WITHOUT APPROVAL.
When using git, DO NOT USE GIT RESET OR GIT COMMIT. DO NOT COMMIT YOUR CHANGES, I will commit them myself.

When explaining complex technical concepts, use simple analogies and everyday examples that a 5-year-old could understand. Ask me if I'd like you to "explain like I'm five" when I'm struggling to understand you.

DO NOT TEST CODE YOURSELF, ask me to do it. If you must, provide a manual test plan I can follow instead.

## Language specific rules

### TypeScript

Don't use return types unless they add value. Ask me before adding them if you're unsure.

Always use braces with if statements. Do not put them on one line.

<example>
For example, avoid this:

```typescript
if (!monthLimit) return false;
```

Do this instead:

```typescript
if (!monthLimit) {
  return false;
}
```

</example>
